#copy module in Ansible cannot copy directories

#/var/log/messages:This is the default system log file where general system messages are stored.
#/var/log/secure:This log file contains security-related messages, such as authentication attempts.

#daily:Specifies that the logs should be rotated daily.Log rotation frequency can also be set to weekly or monthly based on requirements.
#rotate 7:Keeps the last 7 rotated log files.Older files beyond this number are deleted automatically.
#compress:Compresses the rotated log files to save disk space.Compressed files typically have extensions like .gz.
#missingok:If the specified log file is missing, logrotate skips the rotation process for that file without raising an error.
#notifempty: Prevents rotation of empty log files.This avoids unnecessary creation of rotated files if the original file contains no data.
